# 5G-Network-Slicing_Katana-NBI-Gr-33
Developed Katana NBI, an open-source 5G network slicing manager, enabling efficient creation, deployment, and monitoring of virtual slices. Our work focused on enhancing slice orchestration, abstracting resource management complexities, and integrating with network infrastructures to meet diverse application and service requirements.

# Network Slicing Using Katana NBI

## üöÄ **Introduction**
Network slicing is a key feature of 5G networks that enables the creation of multiple virtual networks on top of shared physical infrastructure. This innovation allows service providers to tailor network capabilities to specific applications and services, such as **enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)** for high-speed data, **massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)** for IoT devices, and **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC)** for mission-critical applications.

This repository focuses on the implementation of **network slicing** using the **Katana Northbound Interface (NBI)**, an open-source slice manager that simplifies the orchestration and management of network slices. Katana NBI provides RESTful APIs to define, modify, and manage slices, ensuring efficient resource utilization while meeting diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

By leveraging Katana NBI, we aim to demonstrate how advanced network slicing can optimize 5G networks, providing a foundation for scalable and flexible connectivity solutions across industries.
